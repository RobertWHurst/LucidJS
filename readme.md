#LucidJS

##Decouple components, make them lucid.

LucidJS is a library that allows you to make your own event emitters with ease.
Its fully featured and works with plain old script tags, AMD module loaders, or even as a nodeJS module.



##Method documentation


### LucidJS.emitter()

	LucidJS.emitter([object object]) => object emitter
	LucidJS.emitter([object node]) => object emitter
	
Creates an event emitter and returns it. If an object is passed in the object is augmented with emitter methods. If a DOM node is passed in it will also be augmented, however any DOM events emitted by the node will also be emitted by the emitter.

#### Arguments

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>object</td>
			<td>Optional. Any object or array you wish to turn into an emitter.</td>
			<td>object</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<table>

		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>node</td>
			<td>Optional. Any DOM node you wish to turn into an emitter.</td>
			<td>object</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### emitter{}

	emitter => {
		"on": on()
		"once": once()
		"trigger": trigger()
		"set": set()
		"pipe": pipe() => {
			"clear": clear()
		}
		"listeners": listeners() => {
			"clear": clear()
		}
	}

The emitter object is produced `LucidJS.emitter`. Any objects passed into `LucidJS.emitter` will have all of the above methods attached. The emitter object contains the API for interacting with the emitter.


### emitter.on()

	emitter.on(string event, function listener[, ...]) => object binding
	emitter.on(array events, function listener[, ...]) => object binding
	
Binds any number of listener callbacks to an event or an array of events. Whenever the given event or events are triggered or set on emitter, the listener callbacks will be executed. Any arguments passed to `trigger()` after the event will be passed into the listener callbacks on execution.

If any of the listener callbacks return `false`, the `emitter.trigger` or `emitter.set` that fired the event will return false.
If the event was from a DOM node and `false` is returned both `event.stopPropigation` and `event.preventDefault` will be called.

`emitter.on` returns a `binding` object that can be used to modify the event binding.

	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>event</td>
			<td>The name of the event that the listener will be bound to.</td>
			<td>string</td>
		</tr>

			<td>A callback function that will be executed whenever the event given is triggered.</td>
			<td>function</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>

		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>

			<td>function</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### emitter.once()

	emitter.once(string event, function listener[, â€¦]) => object binding

Binds a listener to an event. Acts exactly like `emitter.on` with the exception that once the given event is triggered the binding is automatically cleared. Because of this any listeners bound with `emitter.once` will once fire once.

`emitter.once` returns a `binding` object that can be used to modify the event binding.

#### Arguments

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>event</td>
			<td>The name of the event that the listener will be bound to.</td>
			<td>string</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>listener</td>
			<td>A callback function that will be executed whenever the event given is triggered.</td>
			<td>function</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>events</td>
			<td>An array of event names the listener will be bound to.</td>
			<td>array</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>listener</td>
			<td>A callback function that will be executed whenever the event given is triggered.</td>
			<td>function</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### emitter.trigger()

	emitter.trigger(string event, * arg[, ...]) => bool successful
	emitter.trigger(array events, * arg[, ...]) => bool successful

Triggers an event or an array of events on the emitter. Any listeners bound with `emitter.on` or `emitter.once` will be executed. Any additional arguments passed into `emitter.trigger` excluding the first argument; the event, will be passed to any and all listeners bound to the emitter.

If any listeners triggered explicitly return `false` then `emitter.trigger` will return false as well.

#### Arguments

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>event</td>
			<td>The name of the event that will be triggered.</td>
			<td>string</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>arg</td>
			<td>Any argument to be passed into listeners of the event.</td>
			<td>*</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>events</td>
			<td>An array of event names that will be triggered.</td>
			<td>array</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>arg</td>
			<td>Any argument to be passed into listeners of the event.</td>
			<td>*</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### emitter.set()

	emitter.set(string event, * arg[, ...]) => bool successful
	emitter.set(array events, * arg[, ...]) => bool successful

Works like trigger except that any listeners bound to the event or events after `emitter.set` is called will be fired as soon as they are bound. This is great of events that only happen once such as a `load` event. It prevents your listeners from missing an event because it has already fired prior to binding them.

#### Arguments

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>event</td>
			<td>The name of the event that will be set.</td>
			<td>string</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>arg</td>
			<td>Any argument to be passed into listeners of the event.</td>
			<td>*</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>events</td>
			<td>An array of event names that will be set.</td>
			<td>array</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>arg</td>
			<td>Any argument to be passed into listeners of the event.</td>
			<td>*</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### emitter.pipe()

	emitter.pipe(object emitter[, ...]) => object pipe
	emitter.pipe(string event, object emitter[, ...]) => object pipe
	emitter.pipe(array events, object emitter[, ...]) => object pipe
	
Pipes all events or select events from one or more emitters, into another. Any events emitted by the piped emitters will also be emitted by the emitter pipe was called on. This is extremely powerful and allows you to chain your emitters.

Returns a pipe object that can be used to clear the pipe.

	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>emitter</td>
			<td>The emitter that events will be piped from.</td>
			<td>object</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<table>

			<td>array</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>emitter</td>
			<td>The emitter that events will be piped from.</td>
			<td>object</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### emitter.pipe.clear()

	emitter.pipe.clear([string event])
	
Allows clearing all pipes, or pipes that transport select events. If an event name is given, only listeners bound to that event will be cleared. If no event name is given all bound listeners will be cleared.

#### Arguments

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>event</td>
			<td>Optional. If any pipes are transporting this event they will be cleared.</td>
			<td>string</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### emitter.listeners()

	emitter.listeners([string event]) => object eventlisteners
	
Allows access to the emitter's bound event listeners.

If an event name is given, the array of listeners bound to the named event will be returned. If no event name is given then the events will be returned. The events object contains all event arrays.

Directly editing the listeners array is not recommended, however it may be necessary to achieve certain types of functionally in specific cases.

#### Arguments

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>event</td>
			<td>Optional. The name of the event to expose. The listeners bound the the event will be returned.</td>
			<td>string</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### emitter.listeners.clear()

	emitter.listeners.clear([string event])
	
Clears listeners bound to the emitter. If an event name is given, only listeners bound to that event will be cleared. If no event name is given all bound listeners will be cleared.

#### Arguments

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Allowed Types</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>event</td>
			<td>Optional. The name of the event to clear listeners from.</td>
			<td>string</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
